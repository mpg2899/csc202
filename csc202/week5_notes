Things to do:
1.  Design int/ab "NumericalOperations" for simple operations (add, sub, mult, div).

2.  Implement abstract data type "Fraction" to implement the interface above.

3.  Write driver program.  Allow input two fractions and print out the different results.
Fraction results must be reduced.

Print source code, put all on dvd, put everything into a physical folder.
